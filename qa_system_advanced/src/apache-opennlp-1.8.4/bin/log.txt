| Dominic Crossan and Richard G. Watts state that the crucifixion of Jesus is as

| parents = }}
}}


Jesus; }} , also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth and Jesus Christ, was
a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader. He is the central figure
of Christianity. Most Christians believe him to be the incarnation of God the
Son and the awaited Messiah  prophesied in the Old Testament.


Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed
historically, Richard A. Burridge states: "There are those who argue that Jesus
is a figment of the Churchs imagination, that there never was a Jesus at all. I
have to say that I do not know any respectable critical scholar who says that
any more". Robert M. Price does not believe that Jesus existed, but agrees that
this perspective runs against the views of the majority of scholars. James D. G.
Dunn calls the theories of Jesus non-existence "a thoroughly dead thesis".
Michael Grant  wrote in 1977, "In recent years, no serious
scholar has ventured to postulate the non historicity of Jesus or at any rate
very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed
very abundant, evidence to the contrary". Robert E. Van Voorst states that
biblical scholars and classical historians regard theories of non-existence of
Jesus as effectively refuted.}} although the quest for the historical Jesus has
produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on
how closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the historical Jesus.}}
Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently
began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to
as "rabbi". Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in
healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. He was arrested and tried
by the Jewish authorities, and turned over to the Roman government, and was
subsequently crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. After
his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they
formed eventually became the early Church.

The birth of Jesus is celebrated annually on December 25 (or various dates in
January by some eastern churches) as a holiday known as Christmas. His
crucifixion is honored on Good Friday, and his resurrection is celebrated on
Easter. The widely used calendar era "AD", from the Latin anno Domini ("in the
year of the Lord"), and the alternative "CE", are based on the approximate birth
date of Jesus.

largest PC software company.}} Gates led the company as chief executive officer
until stepping down in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the
position of chief software architect for himself. In June 2006, Gates announced
that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time
work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was
established in 2000. He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig
