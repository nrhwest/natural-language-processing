Dennis: You gave Rex jaguar!
Dennis: There aren't jaguars in barns!
Dennis: Plus, what the hell am I suppose to do with a mule? You can't make a mule sexy!
Frank: Dennis, you've been out-modeled.
Dennis: I have not been out model. I haven't even begun to work this hot body.
Dennis: What's the next event?
* Franks to Dennis, looks him straight in the eyes *
Frank: The Clothes Off, Pose Off.
